<h1>IAN WINSLOW Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>
<h2>First, the basics.</h2>
<br>You need the following to build your website.
<ul>
    <li>HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
</ul>
<br>You should list your top 5 albums below. This is to show you know how to use a list element.
<ol>
    <li>Oncle Jazz - Men I Trust</li>
    <li>Dark Side of the Moon - Pink Floyd</li>
    <li>Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter - Josh Ritter</li>
    <li>On and On - Jack Johnson</li>
    <li>Forlorn - Those Who Ride With Giants</li>
</ol>
<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
Sometimes you want to <i>draw attention to something</i> in a line of text.
<br>
<br>Sometimes you want to <b>strongly emphasize something</b> in the text.
<br>
<br>Sometimes you want to <i><b>do both</b></i>.
<br>
<br>Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

<h3>Images</h3>
<br>
Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.

<br>
<img src='images/mochi.jpg' alt="jpg Image"/>
<img src='images/mochi.gif' alt="gif Image"/>
<img src='images/mochi.png' alt="PNG Image"/>
<img src='images/mochi.svg' alt="SVG Image"/>

If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."
